Dear Executive,

YOUR INPUT IS VERY VALUABLE. Over the past week or so, you've been invited to participate in a very important survey that will significantly improve the information products available to you in the power and energy industry.

Because we haven't heard from you yet, we're adding more prizes to encourage participation. There are now 12 prizes you could win; we've added 4 more inducements to the original 8 prizes.

YOUR CHANCE OF WINNING IS HUGE. We're hoping to draw a total of 200 respondents from this sector of the industry. When we receive your fully completed questionnaire, your e-mail address will one among 30 in a drawing that could bring you one of the 12 prizes. Those odds aren't bad at all! The prizes include:

-- FOUR $100 gift certificates
-- EIGHT $50 gift certificates

IF YOU WIN, you can choose from the following list where you'd like to spend your gift certificate:

-- Amazon.com,
-- REI.com,
-- GOLFDISCOUNT.com,
-- CABELLAS.com,
-- fogdog.com, or
-- a general American Express gift certificate.

Just click on the long blue URL listed in the section below this letter to connect to the welcome page for the survey.

THE DEADLINE FOR SUBMITTING YOUR SURVEY IS FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 7.

Thanks for your participation, and we wish you the best of luck in the
drawing!
